Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

8. Does posting more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:



 RESULTS: 

The top three users who have more comments are not the ones who have more fans. Other factors can influence this number; such as the quality of the comments or number of friends. More research has to be done about it. If we search who has more fans, Amy has only made 609 reviews and has 503 fans, much more than user #1 in Review count table.

SQL:

REVIEW COUNT:

user.id
,user.name

9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: There are more reviews with the word "love" (1780) than with the word "hate" (232).

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

LOVE:

select 
	count (lower(text))  as times
from review 
where text like "%love%"

Answer= 1780

HATE:

select 
	count (lower(text))  as times
from review

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

	Group #1 which has 3 stars reviews works in night shift. On the other hand, group 2, which has 4 and 5 stars, has a wide variety of working hours. There are many businesses and their distribution of hours are diverse as well.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

	They do. Group number 1, which has 3 stars, have 141 reviews. While in group # 2, in the same category "bars", has 75 reviews and 4 stars.           
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

	Both groups are located in the same place, according to the postal code, businesses from group 1 and group 2 can be found in postal code 85225. Then, the number of stars is not determined by the location. 

Also, we can infer that there are many businesses in the area that covers postal codes from 85224 - 85226. It could be a commercial area.

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         
The ones that are closed are related to entertainment, partys or night life. While the businesses which are open are those related to daily life or family life.
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
Half of the closed business are in the area that I previously thought was a commercial area. It could be that a new law was implemented and that part of the city was affected or some kind of city construction is running.
